An accessibility-focused web app to help colourblind users interpret visual data. Allows user to upload an image, mouse over a pixel, and receive a label for that colour.
Under development by Rhys Fenwick, 2024, as part of an Australian National University accessibility project.

## TODO
- Add a "do you want to compress this image" function
- Make crosshairs fall on pixel, not between them
- Add credits
- Arrows move one pixel at a time
- Make scrollbars fall outside image if possible
