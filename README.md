# Pixel Whisperer
An accessibility-focused web app to help colourblind users interpret visual data. Allows user to upload an image, mouse over a pixel, and receive a label for that colour.
Under development by Rhys Fenwick, 2025, as part of an Australian National University accessibility project.

## TODO
- Make crosshairs fall on pixel, not between them
- Make scrollbars fall outside image if possible
- Intensity measurement? (possibly HSV rather than RGB, or alpha channel)
- Add live feed function

## Broader Accessibility
- Keyboard controls (maybe have keyboard input reset to top left?)
- Bulk file analysis

## Fixes needed
- Pixel off-by-one
- General button padding reduction/spacing
- Redo ANU branding/overall aesthetics
- Arrows moving main window (done)
- Mag glass resets on size change
- Touch functionality (done-ish)
- Phone layout centering
- Camera to switch off when tab not in use
- Add on-screen controls for touch devices (done?)
- Make crosshairs start in middle on touch devices (done)
- Picture shouldn't resize with window resize!!
