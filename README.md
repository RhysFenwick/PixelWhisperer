# Pixel Whisperer
An accessibility-focused web app to help colourblind users interpret visual data. Allows user to upload an image, mouse over a pixel, and receive a label for that colour.
Under development by Rhys Fenwick, 2025, as part of an Australian National University accessibility project.

## TODO
- Make crosshairs fall on pixel, not between them
- Add credits
- Make scrollbars fall outside image if possible
- Fix offset zoomed-in pixel coords
- Intensity measurement? (possibly HSV rather than RGB, or alpha channel)
- Saturation slider?
- Add live feed function
